5_descr=United States Nubira models came equipped only with an Australian built Holden produced DOHC \
  16-valve 2.0-liter inline-4 General Motors "D-Tec" gasoline engine paired with either a Daewoo-designed D-20 \
  five-speed manual transaxle or optional GM sourced 4T40E auto. Producing 136 lb⋅ft (184 N⋅m) torque at 4,400 rpm, \
  the GM Family-II engine had a square 3.4" stroke and a 3.4" bore and at 5,400 rpm making 129 bhp (96 kW; 131 PS). \
  International market Nubiras had a choice of a Daewoo "E-Tech" 1.6, or Holden 1.8 or 2.0-litre inline-four gasoline \
  engines: no diesel version was ever offered, although the Worthing Technical Centre installed Renault's F8 1.9-litre \
  engine in a small number of test vehicles, under a development programme known as J151.
6_descr=In 1992, Daewoo dissolved its joint-venture with General Motors, and simultaneously a decision was made to \
  independently develop replacements for the contemporary Daewoo Motors products, based on older General Motors models. \
  The Lanos development programme was formally started in autumn 1993, with the goal to create a car to replace Daewoo \
  Nexia as Daewoo's small family car.
7_descr=The Chevrolet Spark is a city car produced by GM Korea, originally marketed prominently as the Daewoo Matiz. \
  It has been available solely as a five-door hatchback. \
  The first generation of Daewoo Matiz was launched in 1998 by General Motors' South Korean division GM Korea, \
  previously known as Daewoo Motors, replacing the Daewoo Tico. After the General Motors company took control over \
  Daewoo Motors in 2002, it has increasingly been marketed under the Chevrolet badge. The second generation model was \
  introduced in 2005, with the third generation launched in 2010. 
8_descr=Over its years of production, the Tico underwent major modifications to its specifications, mostly to the \
  engine. Originally equipped with a carburetor and producing 48 bhp (36 kW),[3] it was later upgraded to fuel \
  injection, thus passing the Euro 2 pollution standard, whilst also giving an increase in power output. Some versions \
  of the Tico in the Korean domestic market were powered by liquefied petroleum gas.
